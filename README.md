# Prof. Nydia Tejeda-Munoz

### Greetings
Hello, I'm Nydia.  Thank you for checking out my web profile.

### About Me
I am a cancer cell biologist with over 13 years of experience investigating the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly in the context of colon cancer.
My research focuses on targeting endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and lysosomal function to develop novel therapies for Wnt-driven tumors.  By dissecting how Wnt signaling promotes tumor progression through nutrient scavenging and cellular trafficking, I aim to uncover new strategies to impair cancer cells' ability to access nutrients and support growth - revealing vulnerabilities that may be therapeutically exploited.
My ultimate goal is to translate these fundamental insights into actionable approaches that restore healthy cell behavior and improve patient outcomes.
Currently, I serve as a reviewer for the NIH Cell Structure and Function 1 (CSF1) Study Section (2025), contributing to the evaluation of innovative grant proposals in cell biology.

I am seeking to transition into industry as a Field Application Scientist, where I can combine my scientific expertise with a passion for communication, collaboration, and real-world impact.
